                    2. Disclaimer
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The materials on Laracasts's web site are provided "as is". Laracasts makes no
                    warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other
                    warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of
                    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of
                    intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, Laracasts does not
                    warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or
                    reliability of the use of the materials on its Internet web site or otherwise
                    relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

                    3. Limitations
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In no event shall Laracasts or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including,
                    without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business
                    interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Laracasts's
                    Internet site, even if Laracasts or a Laracasts authorized representative has been
                    notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some
                    jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
                    liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to
                    you.
